# MCMovement - 2D Character Movement and Animation

MCMovement is a simple 2D character movement and animation system built with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a C library for making games. This project allows for character movement in four directions (up, left, down, right) with an animated sprite for each direction.

## Features
- 2D character movement with `WASD` controls.
- Animated character sprites (up, left, down, right) from a sprite sheet.
- Frame-based animation to simulate running in each direction.
- Simple texture loading and unloading for efficient memory management.
- More Features Soon

## Requirements
- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library (version 4.0 or later).
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
